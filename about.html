            Welcome to <span>Ciel High</span>, We are a community of learners dedicated to providing high-quality education to our students. With 360 pupils and 40 classes, we strive to create a warm and welcoming environment that fosters academic and personal growth.
            
            At our school, we offer a comprehensive curriculum that covers a range of subjects. Our students engage with around 20 subjects including Mathematics, English, Science, Social Studies, Civic Education, and Creative Arts, among others. Our highly qualified and experienced teachers use a variety of teaching methods to ensure that every student is able to learn and grow at their own pace.
            
            We believe that education is not just about academics, but also about developing the whole child. That's why we offer a range of extracurricular activities that allow our students to explore their interests and talents. From sports and music to drama and debate, there is something for every student to get involved in.
            
            Our school is committed to providing a safe and inclusive environment where all students feel valued and supported. We believe that every child has the potential to succeed, and we work hard to help them reach their goals. Our teachers are dedicated to building positive relationships with their students and creating a sense of community within the classroom.
            
            We also value parent involvement and believe that it plays a critical role in a child's education. We encourage parents to get involved in their child's education by attending parent-teacher meetings, volunteering, and supporting school events.
            
            Thank you for considering our school for your child's education. We look forward to welcoming you to our community of learners.</p>
